    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">Failure probability evaluation for complex physical and engineering systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are computationally intensive, especially when high-dimensional random parameters are involved. 
    Since standard numerical schemes for solving these complex PDEs are expensive, traditional Monte Carlo methods which require repeatedly solving PDEs are infeasible. Alternative approaches which are typically the surrogate based methods suffer from the so-called ``curse of dimensionality", which limits their application to problems with high-dimensional parameters. For this purpose, we develop a novel hierarchical neural hybrid (HNH) method to efficiently compute failure probabilities of these challenging high-dimensional  problems. Especially,  multifidelity surrogates are constructed based on neural networks with different levels of layers,  such that expensive highfidelity surrogates are adapted only when the parameters are in the suspicious domain. The efficiency of our new HNH method is theoretically analyzed and is demonstrated with numerical experiments. From numerical results, we show that to achieve an accuracy in estimating the rare failure probability (e.g., $10^{-5}$), the traditional Monte Carlo method needs to solve PDEs more than a  million times, while our HNH only requires solving them a few thousand times. </div></p>

    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> We examine the extent to which participation in high school athletics has beneficial effects on future education, labor market, and health outcomes. Due to the absence of plausible instruments in observational data, we use recently developed methods that relate selection on observables with selection on unobservables to estimate bounds on the causal effect of athletics participation. We analyze these effects in the US separately for men and women using three different nationally representative longitudinal data sets that each link high school athletics participation with later-life outcomes. We do not find consistent evidence of individual benefits reported in many previous studiesâ€”once we have accounted for selection, high school athletes are no more likely to attend college, earn higher wages, or participate in the labor force. However, we do find that men (but not women) who participated in high school athletics are more likely to exercise regularly as adults. Nevertheless, athletes are no less likely to be obese. </div></p>

      Abstract
    </button>
    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> We study heterogeneity in the effect of immigrant labor supply on native wages in the United States using quasi-experimental variation induced by the Immigration Act of 1990. The Act quickly and substantially increased the number of immigrant workers in STEM occupations. Using CPS data, we find short-run policy effects of reduced wages for more substitutable workers but increased wages for more complementary workers. We analyze long-term effects of the policy using administrative earnings data and find smaller long-run effects. </div></p>

      Abstract
    </button>
    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Does temperature affect real economic activity? Using the annual Current Population Survey between 1963 and 2015, we show that there is no association between temperature and earnings, hours, or output after controlling for time-invariant spatial heterogeneity and time-varying demographic factors. These results are robust to five separate sources of micro-data, different sampling horizons, functional forms, spatial measures of temperature, and subsets of the data. This paper studies the relationship between temperature and productivity across space and time. Motivated by these null results, we develop a spatial equilibrium model where temperature can affect not only firm productivity, but also individual locational choice. After calibrating the model, we use it to disentangle the role of reallocation versus actual productivity losses in the U.S. economy between 1980 and 2015. Nearly all of the variation is driven by reallocation. We subsequently use the model to evaluate a counterfactual climate scenario and recover a new spatial equilibrium for the U.S. economy by 2050. </div></p>

    <p style="margin:0;" }><p > <b>Language Environment at Home and Academic Achievement During Early Childhood</b> <br> with <a href="http://www.jgjiagao.com/">Jia Gao</a> and <a href="http://www.lewangecon.com/">Le Wang</a>. <br> <button class="accordion">
      Abstract
    </button>
    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper examines the impact of a heretofore relatively unexplored input in the educational process&mdash;language environment at home&mdash;on student academic achievement during early childhood. Using the confidential data from Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class (1998-99), we are able to exploit cross-sectional geographic variation in local language environment, augmented with the recently developed instrumental variable strategy in Lewbel (2012), to identify the causal effect. We reach several conclusions. First, we find that in the third grade, speaking a language other than English at home has a statistically significant, negative effect on reading test scores, but the effect does not exist for math test scores. Second, the pattern persists through the fifth grade. However, the negative effect on reading test scores appears to be a result of the initial gap in the third grade because we do not find the language environment at home has any effects on the growth rates in the test scores, regardless of subjects. Third, the pattern in the effects of language environment remains unchanged whether the foreign language is Spanish or not. Finally, we find that the pattern differs across gender. The language environment appears to have a negative effect on both reading and math scores among girls, while it has an effect only on reading scores among boys.</div></p>

      Abstract
    </button>
    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper examines location as an outcome of college major choice. We document substantial differences in the spatial availability of college majors. These differences explain much of the cross-major variation in unemployment and migration, but not earnings. Using a natural experiment, we show that migration differences across majors appear to be driven by labor demand and not labor supply.</div></p>
